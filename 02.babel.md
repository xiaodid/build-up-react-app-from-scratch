## babel

Currently, babel has upgraded to 7.0. 7.0 is big different from 6.0, including packages, plugins and presets. You can follow this [migration doc](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/v7-migration) to update to 7.0

following packages we will use:
* @babel/core the core functionality of Babel. In babel 6, it is babel-core
* @babel/cli is a tool that allows you to use babel from the terminal. In babel 6, it is babel-cli
* @babel/node is splited in babel 7 from babel-cli
* Preset is a set of plugins used to support particular language features

### install
``` shell
npm install --save-dev @babel/core
npm install --save-dev @babel/cli
npm install --save-dev @babel/node
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-env
```

### configure babel
create a file named ```babel.config.js``` in the root folder.
``` javascript
const presets = [
  ['@babel/env', {
    targets: {
      node: 'current',
    },
  }]
]

module.exports = { presets }
```

In babel 6, ```.babelrc``` was used. However, in babel7, ```babel.config.js``` is introduced, and is recommended.
