## react

### install [React](https://reactjs.org/)
Currently, react has upgraded to 16, it introduced many new features, and it has some differences from older version. (https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html)

``` shell
npm install --save react
npm install --save react-dom
npm install --save prop-types
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react
```

* babel-preset-react let Babel can compile JSX.
> Note, the Flow syntax is not support by preset-react, you have to add @babel/preset-flow separately

### modify babel config file
In fact, we needn't to modify babel config file. because we don't compile react via babel-cli. This job will be done by babel-loader in webpack.
