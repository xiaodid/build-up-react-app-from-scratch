# Build up a react project from scratch

Currently, front web development is different from the past, there are many tools, frameworks have to be understood. [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) are the most popular tools/framework in front-end development eco.

Although, [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) comes to help us set-up a ready-to-use env, but we still need to know the magic behind it. How do webpack, babel works togather.

## Precondition
I assume that you know what React/Babel/Webpack are.

## Node.js
First of all, you need to install nodejs, it is a JavaScript VM to run JavaScript in our local machine instead of browser.

We recommend [LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

> in this tutorial, we will use ```npm``` instead of ```yarn```
